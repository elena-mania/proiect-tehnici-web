            <p>David Lynch, in full David Keith Lynch, was born 20th of January 1946 in Missoula, Montana, U.S. American filmmaker and screenwriter who is known for his uniquely disturbing and mind-bending visual work.
                His films juxtapose the cheerfully mundane with the shockingly macabre and often defy explanation.</p>
            <p>Much like his body of work, David Lynch often defied tidy description. As a filmmaker it was possibly more instructive to refer to him as a
                surrealist artist working in the medium of film, rather than a traditional movie director and writer. From his debut feature "Eraserhead" (1978), it was clear that Lynch held a deep fascination with the utterly grotesque residing just below the surface of the everyday.</p>
