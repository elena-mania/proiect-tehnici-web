            <p>David Lynch, in full David Keith Lynch, was born 20th of January 1946 in Missoula, Montana, U.S. He is an american filmmaker and screenwriter who is best known for his uniquely disturbing and mind-bending visual work.
                His films juxtapose the cheerfully mundane with the shockingly macabre and often defy explanation.</p>
            <p>Much like his body of work, David Lynch often defied tidy description. As a filmmaker it was possibly more instructive to refer to him as a
                surrealist artist working in the medium of film, rather than a traditional movie director and writer. From his debut feature "Eraserhead" (1978), it was clear that Lynch held a deep fascination with the utterly grotesque residing just below the surface of the everyday.</p>
